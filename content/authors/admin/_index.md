Dr. Nauroze received his BSc. in Computer Engineering (honors) from University of Engineering & Technology, Taxila (Pakistan) in 2005, MSc. in Electrical Engineering (Wireless Systems) from Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) Stockholm, Sweden in 2008, MSc. and PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Electromagnetics & MEMS) from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA in 2018 and 2019 respectively. He also holds Management of Technology certificate from Scheller School of Business (Georgia Institute of Technology) with focus on entrepreneurship & small business development. He is a recipient of prestigious Swedish Institute and Fulbright scholarships in 2006 and 2014 respectively.

During Fall 2017, Dr. Nauroze worked at Qualcomm San Diego (USA) where he was part of the 5G antenna design team responsible for design, testing and realization of 5G phased array antennas for handheld devices. He was also part of National Science Foundation - Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program in spring 2018, after which he co-founded an Atlanta based tech startup, Atheraxon. The focus of the company is to provide long-range (upto 1 km) wireless RFID-based sensors for smart agriculture, assest tracking and enviromental monitoring. In summer 2019, he was involved with realization of smart noise immune antennas at Amazon Lab126 Sunnyvale, CA that improve desence in Alexa enabled devices. Dr. Nauroze has also held various academic positions (for more than 7 years) at some of the most prestigious universities in Pakistan including *University of Engineering & Technology, Taxila*, *LUMS - Syed Babar Ali School of Science & Engineering* and *National University of Computer & Emergince Sciences (Islamabad)*. He has authored/co-authored 36 scientific papers in some of the most prestigeous peer-reviewed journals and conferences in the world including *Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)*, *IEEE Proceedings*, *IEEE Trasactions on Microwave Theory & Techniques* and *IEEE International Microwave Symposium (IMS)* to name a few. The work has also been highlighted in some of the renowned international media outlets. Dr. Nauroze also serves as reviewer of various prestigeous journals & conferences including *Nature Scientific reports*, *IEEE Antenna & Wireless Propagation Letters*, *Elsevier - Additive Manufacturing Journal*, *MDPI - Sensors*, *IEEE Antenna & Propagation Society (APS)* and *Radio Wireless Week (RWR) conference*. He is also one of the mentors for [National Incubation Center Lahore (Pakistan)](https://niclahore.lums.edu.pk/) - a first-of-its-kind incubation and acceleration platform that aims to promote entrepreneurship amongst college graduate and young entrepreneurs in Pakistan for medium to small business development through public and private partnership.

Dr. Nauroze's primary research interests lie at the intersection of art, deployable structures, material science and applied electromagnetics. The central theme of my research is investigation of novel techniques to realize smart tunable multilayer “4D” RF structures using additive manufacturing technologies (AMTs) such as inkjet-printing and 3D-printing, that can tune their frequency response on-demand by simply changing their shape. These structures draw inspiration from ancient Japanese art of paper folding called *origami*, which gives a systematic methodology to transform a 2D surface into a complex 3D structure. This presents a paradigm shift in realization of fully printed complex, tunable & structurally robust 4D RF structures that would otherwise be impossible to realize using conventional fabrication technologies such as photolithography and milling.
