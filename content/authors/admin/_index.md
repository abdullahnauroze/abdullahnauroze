Dr. Nauroze recieved his BSc. in Computer Engineering (honors) from University of Engineering & Technology, Taxila (Pakistan) in 2005, MSc. in Electrical Engineering (Wireless Systems) from Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) Stockholm, Sweden in 2008, MSc. and PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Electromagnetics & MEMS) from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA in 2018 and 2019 respectively. He also holds Management of Technology certificate from Scheller School of Business (Georgia Institute of Technology) with focus on entrepenurship & small business development. He is a recipient of prestigeous Swedish Institute and Fulbright scholarhip in 2006 and 2014 respectively.

In spring 2018, Dr. Nauroze was part of National Science Foundation - Innovation Corps (I-Corps) cohort which aims to reduce time & risk associated with translating promising ideas and technologies from the laboratory to the marketplace. Later, he co-founded an Atlanta based tech startup, Atheraxon. During Fall 2017, he worked at Qualcomm San Diego, CA where he was part of the 5G antenna design team responsible for design, testing and realization of 5G phased array antennas for handheld devices. In summer 2019, he was involved with realization of smart noise immune antennas at Amazon Lab126 Sunnyvale, CA that improve desence in Alexa enabled devices. Before joining Georgia Tech as a PhD student, Dr. Nauroze had also served as faculty member (for more than 7 years) at various prestigious universities in Pakistan including University of Engineering & Technology Taxila, LUMS - Syed Babar Ali School of Science & Engineering and National University of Computer & Emergince Sciences (Islamabad). Moreover, he also recieved graduate assistanceship in Spring 2005 to work on fractal antennas at University of Technology Petronas (Malaysia).

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of art, deployable structures, material science and applied electromagnetics. The central theme of my research is investigation of novel techniques to realize smart tunable multilayer “4D” RF structures using additive manufacturing technologies (AMTs) such as inkjet-printing and 3D-printing, that can tune their frequency response on-demand by simply changing their shape. These structures draw inspiration from ancient Japanese art of paper folding called *origami*, which gives a systematic methodology to transform a 2D surface into a complex 3D structure. This presents a paradigm shift in realization of fully printed complex, tunable & structurally robust 4D RF structures that would otherwise be impossible to realize using conventional fabrication technologies such as photolithography and milling.
